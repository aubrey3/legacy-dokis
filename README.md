This is the legacy version of the Doki's code, it has been decommisioned from service, as the rewrite branch has replaced it. this is more of an honerary branch and this code is no longer going to be developed.
Thank you to everyone who has worked on this code over the years.

Also note this code is absolutely riddled with bugs and issues, have fun
